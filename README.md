# Smart Waste Classification System for Recycling

## Description
The **Smart Waste Classification System** is designed to identify and categorize waste items to determine their recyclability. With increasing global waste production, proper waste segregation plays a crucial role in environmental sustainability. This project leverages data-driven classification techniques to improve recycling efforts by accurately distinguishing between different types of waste.

The system classifies waste into six categories:
- **Cardboard** – Used for packaging materials, boxes, and cartons.
- **Glass** – Includes glass bottles, jars, and broken glassware.
- **Metal** – Comprises aluminum cans, tin containers, and metallic scraps.
- **Non-recyclable Waste** – Items that cannot be processed for recycling (e.g., contaminated or hazardous waste).
- **Paper** – Newspapers, magazines, office paper, and paperboard.
- **Plastic** – Includes PET bottles, food containers, and plastic packaging.

To achieve high classification accuracy, the project utilizes three machine learning algorithms:
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** – A deep learning model that processes waste features through multiple neural network layers.
- **Random Forest (RF)** – An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees to improve classification reliability.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** – A powerful algorithm that finds the best decision boundary for waste classification.

The system processes waste data, trains models using machine learning, and predicts the waste category for proper disposal or recycling. This initiative aims to support waste management facilities, smart cities, and environmental sustainability programs by automating waste segregation processes.
