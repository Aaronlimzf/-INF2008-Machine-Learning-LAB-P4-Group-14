Data Collection & Preprocessing
The dataset contains images or structured data of different waste materials.
Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustments were applied to improve model generalization.
Features were extracted and normalized for optimal training performance.
Steps in preprocessing:

Data cleaning
Label encoding
Train-test split
Feature scaling
